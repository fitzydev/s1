# About This Repository
The goal of this repo is to provide a transparent look into how [Schedule 1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/) works. Whether you're a new game developer, a curious player, or a seasoned developer, you'll find everything you need to dive into the game's mechanics, assets, and logic in this repo.

If you are not experienced with reverse engineering and decompiling, I recommend going to https://github.com/ifBars/S1API where they have done all the work for you.
